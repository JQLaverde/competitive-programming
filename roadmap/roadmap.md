## Competitive Programming Roadmap

**Introduction**

This roadmap will guide you on your journey to becoming a successful competitive programmer. It will provide you with a structure to learn the skills and knowledge necessary to participate in competitive programming competitions.

**Stage 1: Programming Fundamentals**

* **Learn a programming language:** C++ is the most popular language in competitive programming, but Python and Java are also viable options.
* **Master basic data structures:** Arrays, lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, etc.
* **Learn basic algorithms:** Linear and binary search, sorting, disjoint-set data structures, etc.
* **Practice with easy problems:** You can use platforms like HackerRank: [https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or Codeforces: [https://codeforces.com/](https://codeforces.com/) to find problems of varying difficulty.

**Stage 2: Advanced Algorithms**

* **Learn graph algorithms:** Dijkstra, Kruskal, Floyd-Warshall, etc.
* **Learn computational geometry algorithms:** Rectangles, triangles, points, etc.
* **Learn dynamic programming algorithms:** Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.
* **Practice with medium difficulty problems:** Continue using platforms like HackerRank: [https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or Codeforces: [https://codeforces.com/](https://codeforces.com/) to find problems of greater difficulty.

**Stage 3: Competitive Training**

* **Participate in online contests:** There are many free online contests held regularly, such as Codeforces: [https://codeforces.com/](https://codeforces.com/) or AtCoder: [https://atcoder.jp/contests/](https://atcoder.jp/contests/).
* **Join a training group:** You can find online or in-person training groups to practice with other students.
* **Analyze solutions from other competitors:** Reading solutions from other competitors will help you learn new techniques and improve your own code.
* **Stay updated:** Keep up with the latest advancements in competitive programming by reading blogs, articles, and papers.
